# Summary

UD Quechua-QWH is the first treebank for Ancash Quechua, a variety of the Central Andean Quechua language family. It consists of sentences extracted from several text genres: tales, narratives and a short novel.

# Introduction

The treebank includes sentences from the following sources:
- *Cuentos y relatos en el quechua de Huaraz* (1975), two volumes of autobiographical chronicles and tales from the oral tradition by Santiago Pantoja Ramos, a Quechua native speaker from the province of Huaraz, Peru;
- *Apu Kolki Hirka*, by Macedonio Villafán Broncano (1997), the first short novel in Ancash Quechua, whose style can be assimilated to prose poetry;
- Entries of the Ancash Quechua dictionary issued by the Peruvian Ministry of Education in 2005;
- A set of tales published in low-circulation during the 1990s, from the *Cuentos Pintados del Perú* project (1994-2015) which aimed to support bilingual intercultural education by bringing together traditional tales from all over the world translated into Quechua.

# Acknoledgments

Many thanks to Professor Villafán Broncano who gave his consent to the use of his work for reasearch purpose.
